    		In the Rickson Gracie Jiu Jitsu we find it important that the techniques that teach actually work "on the street" and only teach proven and tested techniques. As far as we are concerned, the best option is to try and avoid a confrontation. But when it comes down to it, you will be able to 'stand your ground'.
